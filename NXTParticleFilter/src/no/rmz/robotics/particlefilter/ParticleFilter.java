/**
 * This class implements a particle filter localization estimation algorithm.
 *
 * It has two sets of particles, old and new, both implemented as arrays of
 * particle. The basic flow of the algorithm is:
 *
 * Start with a set of particles randomly spread out over the area where we
 * suspect the vehicle is located in.
 *
 * Then, given the current sensor input, filter and resample, then then add
 * movement based on estimated speed (with Gaussian noise) and repeat.
 *
 * XXX Refactor to niceness before continuing.
