This is an experiment in creating a particle filter based navigation
system for the LEGO NXT robotic system.

The system is written in Java using the lejos <<ref missing>> 
alternative runtime system for the NXT bricks.

IMPORTANT:  This code doesn't actually work.  I've just typed
it in and compiled it.  It's neither complete nor correct. It's
a work in progress :-)

I'm working on the correctness now, and the first step is
a review (I'm doing that now), but I would really like to
get some unit tests up and running. Unfortunately Lejos and
Junit  don't play nice out of the box so I have some thinking
to do before that can be done.   Then I need to calibrate
the sensors so the probability distributions used
in the filter will use somewhat correct prior 
probabilities, and finally I'll have to run the robot on
some track and see what it does.

It would be nice if the robot could use bluetooth to
transmit its belief-state to the mothership (my
laptop) for realtime visualization, but that's a feature
rather a long way down in my priority list, though not
at the bottom.

If you have an interest in this project or even better,
have something to contribute (review, ideas, assistance
on how to get JUnit to work with lejos) pleas contact me
